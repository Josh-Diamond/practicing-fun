    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>This page will always and forever be the hardest for me to write. Where do I even begin. I was born in Phoenix, Arizona. I moved more times than I can even count. I have been to forty-eight of the fifty states. The only two states that I have not been to is Hawaii and Alaska. I do have a few hobbies that include; gaming, cooking, guitar, drawing, and disc golfing. If I had to choose what my favorite video game of all time it would have to be Final Fantasy X. It was my first Final Fantasy game. So it introduced me to the series. Right now I mostly play Old School Runescape. It is a game that I have been playing for a long time. I believe I started playing the Runescape games when I was in the third grade. So 2003 or 2004 area. I did stop for a few years and picked up the game more recently. This is where I have started to actually explore what the game has to offer. I have been married and divorced. I feel like there is not much more I can talk about. So the end.</p>
